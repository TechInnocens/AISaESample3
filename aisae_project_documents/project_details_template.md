**Stakeholders**
- Retail investors (primary users)
- Financial advisors (some integration partnerships)
- Regulatory bodies (SEC, FINRA, state regulators)
- Asset management companies (ETF providers)
- Banking partners (custodial services)
- Company shareholders and employees
- Compliance and audit teams
